                <h2>Fingerprint history</h2>
                <p>
                    A fingerprint is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger. The recovery of partial fingerprints from a crime scene
					is an important method of forensic science. Moisture and grease on a finger result in fingerprints on surfaces such as glass or metal.
					Deliberate impressions of entire fingerprints can be obtained by ink or other substances transferred from the peaks of friction ridges
					on the skin to a smooth surface such as paper. Fingerprint records normally contain impressions
					from the pad on the last joint of fingers and thumbs, though fingerprint cards also typically record portions of lower joint areas of the fingers.

                <p>
                    Google was officially launched in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to market Google Search, which has become the most used web-based search engine.
					Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University in California, developed a search algorithm at first known as "BackRub" in 1996, with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg
					. The search engine soon proved successful and the expanding company moved several times, finally settling at Mountain View in 2003.

                <h2>Bell History</h2>
                <p>
                    Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.[8] His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with 
					hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876 </p>
